> Size: S | M | L
> Depends on: [task numbers or "none"]

## What

What to build. Be specific about the files to create or modify.

## How

Implementation approach. Reference existing patterns in the codebase.
For complex tasks, include a code sketch. For simple ones, a sentence suffices.

## Files

- `path/to/file` — create | modify

## Acceptance

Observable behaviors that prove this task is done:
- Verify command passes clean
- [specific observable behavior]
- [specific observable behavior]

## Done

- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Verify command passes
- [ ] Tests: [output or N/A with reason]
- [ ] Committed: [sha]

## Notes

Filled during implementation. Deviations from plan, discoveries, gotchas.
